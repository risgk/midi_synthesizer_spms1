Usage
-----

### Prebuilt Binary

- "spms1_type0.ino.uf2" (in the "bin" folder) is for Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and Pimoroni Pico Audio Pack


### Web Editor

- Cross-platform web-based parameter controller via Web MIDI API: "spms1_editor.html"
- Built-in software keyboard for note input and testing


### MIDI Settings

- MIDI Channel: Channel 1
- USB MIDI Input
    - Manufacturer Descriptor: "ISGK Instruments"
    - Device Name: "SPMS-1 (type-0)"
- UART MIDI Input
    - Speed: 31250 bps
    - GP4 and GP5 pins are used by UART1 TX and UART1 RX
    - You can also use `SoftwareSerial` by making the following changes:

        ```cpp
        #include <SoftwareSerial.h>
        #define SPMS1_UART_MIDI_TX_PIN              (4)
        #define SPMS1_UART_MIDI_RX_PIN              (5)
        SoftwareSerial mySerial(SPMS1_UART_MIDI_RX_PIN, SPMS1_UART_MIDI_TX_PIN);
        #define SPMS1_UART_MIDI_SERIAL              mySerial
        ```

        ```cpp
        //  SPMS1_UART_MIDI_SERIAL.setTX(SPMS1_UART_MIDI_TX_PIN);
        //  SPMS1_UART_MIDI_SERIAL.setRX(SPMS1_UART_MIDI_RX_PIN);
        ```

    - DIN/TRS MIDI is available by using (and modifying) Adafruit MIDI FeatherWing Kit, for example
