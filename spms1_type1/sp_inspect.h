/* sp_inspect.h -- generic container #inspect, split out of spinel_rt.h.

   sp_inspect_container formats a boxed array or hash in Ruby #inspect form,
   walking it through the generic sp_json_* / sp_poly_inspect_fn hooks (sp_gc.h)
   and building the result with sp_String (sp_string.h). The per-type inspect
   helpers in spinel_rt.h are now one-line wrappers that box their receiver and
   call this, so all the inspect string-building compiles once in the archive
   rather than in every generated TU. */

 * walk that descends into a container -- #inspect, ==, eql?, <=>, #hash,
 * #flatten, #join, puts -- would follow such a cycle until the C stack ran
 * out. CRuby's rb_exec_recursive keeps, per thread, the set of objects (or
 * object PAIRS) the current walk is already inside and answers a fixed result
 * for one it meets again; this is that set, as a small stack.
 *
 * Frames hold raw pointers that are only ever COMPARED, never dereferenced:
 * the collector does not move objects, and pushing a frame allocates nothing,
 * so a walk cannot collect the very object it is remembering. Per-worker
 * (SP_TLS) like the exception stack, and carried across a green thread's
 * suspension by sp_exc_ctx_save/load, so two fibers walking at once each keep
 * their own path. */
